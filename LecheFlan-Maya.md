# Leche Flan (Maya's house)
### Ingredients
2‚ÅÑ3 cup white sugar
1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
2 cup heavy cream
1 cup milk
5 egg
2 tsp vanilla extract

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a small nonstick saucepan, heat sugar over medium heat. Shake and swirl occasionally to distribute the sugar until it is dissolved and begins to brown. Lift the pan over the heat source (4 to 6 inches) and continue to cook the sugar until it becomes dark golden brown. You may slightly stir while cooking, but do not continually stir, otherwise the sugar will crystallize. Carefully pour caramelized sugar into a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish or a large loaf pan and swirl to evenly coat the bottom of the pan.

In a blender, combine sweetened condensed milk, cream, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend on High for one minute. Pour over the caramelized sugar. Place the filled casserole dish inside a larger pan and add 1 inch of hot water to the outer pan.

Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the custard has set. Immediately remove casserole dish from the water bath and cool completely. To unmold, run a knife around the edge of the pan and carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate.
