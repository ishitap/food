[adapted from japanese dumplings - seriouseats.com](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/the-best-japanese-pork-and-cabbage-dumplings-gyoza-recipe.html)

### Ingredients
* 1/2 lb minced cabbage
* 1 + 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 lb pork
* 1/2 tsp white pepper
* 1/2 tbsp garlic
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 2 oz scallions (about 3)
* 1 tsp sugar
* 20-30 round dumpling wrappers
* vegetable oil

### Instructions
1. Combine the cabbage and 1 tsp salt, place in a fine mesh strainer and let sit for 15 minutes.
1. Wrap the cabbage in paper towels and squeeze as much water out as possible, then place in a large bowl.
1. Add the remaining 1/2 tsp salt, pork, white pepper, garlic, giner, scallions, and sugar to the cabbage.
1. Knead the cabbage-pork mixture until homogenous and sticky, about 2-3 minutes. 
1. To create the dumplings, set up a workstation with the filling, a small bowl of water, a clean kitchen towel, and a parchment-lined baking sheet or tray. Wrap a little over 1 tbsp filling in each wrapper and place on the tray when finished. 
1. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Fry as many gyoza as possible until the bottom is brown, about 1.5 min, swirling the pan as much as possible.
1. Add 1/2 cup of water and put the lid on the skillet. Steam over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes (5 from frozen). 
1. Remove the lid and evaporate the water. Let the bottom of the gyoza crisp up again, then slide off pan and serve.
