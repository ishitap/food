# Roberta's pizza dough

### Ingredients
* 153 grams 00 flour 
* 153 grams all-purpose flour 
* 8 grams fine sea salt
* 200 g lukewarm water
* 2 grams active dry yeast
* 4 grams extra-virgin olive oil 

### Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.
2. In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.
3. Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.)
4. Use in a pizza recipe.
