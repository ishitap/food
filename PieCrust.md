# Pie Crust
adapted from [smitten kitchen]() and [good housekeeping]()

### Ingredients
* 473 g flour
* 23 g sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 12 oz unsalted butter, cubed and frozen
* 3/4 cup ice water, plus upto 3/4 cup more

### Instructions
1. Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, cover, and place in the freezer.
2. Cube the butter into 1/2 inch cubes and place in a covered bowl in the freezer.
3. When the butter is frozen, combine the flour mix and butter in a food processor and pulse just until the mixture is crumbly, with pea-sized granules. Do not overmix.
4. Move the crumbly dough back into a large, cold bowl. Start by drizzling the first 3/4 cup of the ice water and gathering the dough together. After this, add water 1 tbsp at a time until the dough just comes together. Do not fully knead the dough!
5. Divide the dough into 2 disks, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before rolling out. 
6. Bake at 425 F for 20 minutes or until top is golden, then at 375 F for another 20 minutes or until cooked through.
