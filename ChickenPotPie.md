via [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/10/better-chicken-pot-pies/)

### Ingredients
#### Lid
* 128g all- purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt
* 6.5 tbsp cold unsalted butter, diced
* 3 tbsp sour cream or Greek-style yogurt
* 1/2 tbsp cider vinegar
* 2 tbsp very cold water
* 1/2 beaten egg or 1.5 tbsp milk for wash

#### Marinade
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 3-4 tbsp greek yogurt
* 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
* 1/2 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tbsp garlic
* 1/2 tbsp ginger
* 1/4 tsp cardamom, cinnamon, or nutmeg (optional)
* dash of sherry or vinegar

#### Filling
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* olive oil
* 1.75 - 2 lb bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (breasts, thighs and drumsticks are ideal)
* 1 medium leek, white and light green parts only, cut in half lengthwise and then into 1/2-inch slices
* 1/2 large onion, diced small
* 2 tbsp dry sherry (optional) (this made mine too sweet)
* 1.5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 tbsp milk or heavy cream
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tsp minced fresh thyme
* 1.5 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup fresh or frozen green peas (no need to defrost)
* 1/2 cup carrot, diced small
* 1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley

### Instructions
1. Mix together the marinade ingredients in a bowl, using salt and pepper to season. 
2. Coat the chicken in the marinade, cover and let rest in fridge for at least an hour.
3. Make the lid dough: crumble the flour/salt and butter together until the mixture resembles pea-sized pieces or gramola. In a separate bowl, whisk the remaining ingredients together. Add the whisked liquids to the flour/butter mixture and pull the dough together with your hands. When it just comes together in a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, flatten, and let rest in the fridge for at least an hour.
3. When the chicken has marinated, heat a dash of olive oil over medium-heat in a large cast iron saucepan or dutch oven. Brown the chicken on both sides, until they are golden. Transfer to a plate.
4. In the leftover chicken fat / juices / oil, sautee the onion and leek until tender, about 7 minutes. Deglaze with sherry or water. 
5. Add the chicken broth, milk, bay leaf, and thyme and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the pot, cover and simmer until cooked through (about 30 minutes). 
6. When the chicken is cooked through, remove from the pot and let cool slightly on a place. When it's cool enough to handle, remove the skin and bone, and dice or shred the chicken into small pieces.
7. In a small bowl, mash together the butter and flour until combined. Add 1-2 spoonfuls of the broth and whisk until even. Repeat, and then pour the flour-broth back into the main pot.
8. Bring the pot back to a simmer and let it thicken a bit. 
9. Add the carrots and peas to the pot and simmer until firm-tender, about 3 minutes.
10. Add the diced/shredded chicken back to the pot and heat through again, about 1 minute.
11. Assemble: Preheat oven to 345 F. Roll out the lid two in two halves, so they will fit over two medium-sized casserole or baking dishes with about 1-inch overhang. Cut a vent hole in the middle. Load the dishes with the filling, then top with the lid. Brush lid with milk.
12. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the tops are golden and the filling is bubbling.
