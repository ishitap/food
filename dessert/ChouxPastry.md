# Choux pastry
### Ingredients
* 350 g water
* 350 g milk
* 327 g butter, room temp, in cubes
* 300g flour
* 5g salt
* 9 eggs

### Instructions
1. Add water, milk, and butter to a saucepan and bring to a boil
2. Mix in flour & on medium heat stir it around relatively vigorously for 4-6 minutes
3. Take it off the heat and wait for it to cool
4. Add the salt, then the eggs one by one, completely incorporating each. Add 9 eggs or until it feels like you could pipe it
5. If eclairs, brush with egg wash and top with powdered sugar for a golden finish.
6. Pipe the eclairs onto a baking sheet and spray the sheet with water to add some steam to the oven.
6. Bake at 425 for 15-25 minutes, reduce heat to 375 and bake for another 10-15 minutes. You can adjust the time based on the number of eclairs and whether they are puffing up and browning. Let them get light to medium brown, not pale. Whatever you do, don't open the oven before 25 min or they might deflate - look at them through the oven window.
